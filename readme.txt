These are the codes used in the project development of our robot and in the progression of the module. The codes shown here, some are written by me or Adam Byrne and some are written by Ted Burke/John Mcgrory and adapted by me or Adam Byrne, who was my team-mate. These codes are written in Arduino ide or Arduino C and can be compiled inside the Arduino compiler and uploaded onto a chip.
The files are numbered by the week that it was in, for example, if it is 3.2(a), it was the second part of week three and the first code(a). This is just as an example of what ive
done individually and as a team, and on a project.

# projects
a collection of my different project codes:
# project_1: The Robosimo: Johnny705 - robot car
The car goes around a track, with different colours. It uses the colours to guide itself. It being the predecessor to the Robosumo project.
C programming used here aswell as alternate maps, speeds and colour polarity switching. The colours are based on the TCRT5000 infra-red sensor,
picking up the reflected light bounced back after being emitted.
# project_2: The shapesorter assignment: the sorting of pics
The program sorts .pgm pics that are generated by a blob.exe program given in the package. Through the development stage there were a number of
versions of the shapesorter program. The main mark was given to students who were able to tell whether the object was a blob or solid, or a ring.
through determination of sequencially scanning from the top then, when hitting black, counting the pixels and counting vertically and horizontally inward. If a
gap was detected it would be classified a ring, otherwise a blob or solid. Using this sequencial logic and counting a near centerpoint could be calculated and 
then a 20 x 20 white square could be painted there, if it was a blob, or otherwise a black one if a ring. The program was then able to separate rings and solids into separate folders as copies, then
adjusted copies were put into modified folders and an original folder was made with copies of the originals. When run in the windows command terminal with a directory, folder or image,
would sort the images accordingly. During this project we used "Irfan view 64" to give us an idea, but not neccessary.
# project_3: The Weather Station Simulation & Data Visualization Dashboard python scripts:
These automated, instead of adding one entry at a time to a mariadb table in a database, you could add many entries, or also in a loop, with an option to how many times the loop would run.
Also scripts using a netcat listener for a client input to a database on the server side, which could be used in an arduino. I based our database on a Weather-station being built in another module,
and added two scripts which were temperature and windspeed. I adjusted the listening scripts to rescale the input from the client according to our groups figures.
